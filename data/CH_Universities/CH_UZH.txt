Protective Measures of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)
The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has declared that an “extraordinary situation” exists in Switzerland and the Federal Council is calling on everyone to stay home. The highest priority is to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, protect people at especially high risk, and assure the provision of hospital care for severe cases of infection and all other urgent treatments.

The general protective measures still apply:

Keep your distance. Protect the elderly by keeping a safe distance. Keep your distance from others in a queue and keep your distance at meetings.
Avoid shaking hands and other physical contact when greeting people.
Wash your hands thoroughly. Wash your hands properly several times a day with water and soap.
Cough and sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your arm. Cover your mouth and nose with a paper handkerchief when you sneeze or cough. If you don’t have a tissue, please sneeze or cough into your elbow, not your hands. This is more hygienic. If you do sneeze or cough into your hands, you should wash them straight afterwards using water and soap, if possible.
Stay at home if you have a high temperature and a cough. If you are feeling sick, it is recommended that you stay at home. This will prevent the disease from spreading to others.
Always call ahead before going to the doctor's or the emergency department. Call your GP or the canton’s medical hotline (phone 0800 33 66 55) to discuss the next steps.

Information for Students
Digital Teaching
The increasingly serious developments this week have led the Executive Board of the University to approve the introduction of unprecedented and radical measures for UZH. After consultation with the cantonal authorities, the Executive Board of the University has decided to switch all courses to a distance-learning format from Monday, 16 March 2020 until further notice. Our goal remains the same: to enable you to access teaching materials and to support you in dealing with your course content and in completing the relevant assessments.

In addition, the following steps will be taken, and we ask for your cooperation in this regard:

1. Teaching staff has been requested to provide courses available in a digital format
The Executive Board of the University has requested all teaching staff to make their courses available in a digital format – that does not always mean podcasts, there are also many other online options. We ask for your patience, as the process of moving all courses to digital platforms will take some time. It will not be possible to make all course content available online immediately. You will receive instructions directly from your course instructors about where and how to access the materials.

2. Cancellation window for modules and exams/assessments
In addition, the Executive Board of the University has decided to introduce a window for cancellations in the current semester (likely in the first two weeks of May). This will enable you to cancel your enrollment for modules and exams/assessments without giving a reason, should you feel unable to complete the requirements under the current circumstances.

3. Teaching staff has been requested to inform you in good time about exam contents or assessment requirements
Although we cannot predict how the situation will develop, the teaching staff have been requested to inform you in writing of the exam contents or assessment requirements in good time before the cancellation window opens. This should enable you to decide whether you want to sit the exam/complete the assessment requirements or not.  

4. Libraries will be closed
Starting on Friday, 20 March 6 p.m., the university’s libraries will be closed. Students can order media online and have them delivered to their home free of charge. Individual students may request and be granted access to a library if they need library media/documents that cannot be copied or digitalized.

This extraordinary situation is presenting great challenges for all of us, and we are very aware of that. We are doing everything possible to support you as best we can, and to make sure you get all relevant information in good time. We greatly appreciate your cooperation.

Protective Measures for People at Especially High Risk
UZH members who are at especially high risk according to the criteria of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) are asked to stay at home. Whenever possible, you should work at home. If this is not possible, please consult your line manager.

Who is at especially high risk of getting seriously ill and therefore requires particular protection?
People with chronic medical conditions that weaken the immune system, such as congenital or acquired immune deficiency, cancer or transplants
People taking medication or receiving treatments that weaken the immune system, such as monoclonal antibodies, cytostatic drugs, steroids or biologic drugs
People with chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or high blood pressure
People over the age of 65
Responsibilities of affected employees (incl. PhD candidates) and their supervisors
In order for supervisors to be able to protect employees who are at especially high risk, they need to be aware of the risk factor. Employees who fall into a high risk group should inform their supervisor or line manager. It is not necessary for them to say which of the above-mentioned risk factors applies in their case.
Supervisors should inform their employees of the special protection measures and talk to employees who are at especially high risk, provided the supervisor is aware of the risk.
If you are a supervisor or employee and have any questions or doubts about assessing the health situation or about the necessary measures, you can contact the Occupational Medicine team within the Safety, Security and Environment Office (see contacts in the top right corner).
In case of questions about the working situation or disagreement about measures, supervisors or employees can choose to involve the HR consultant responsible for their area. (see contacts in the top right corner)
Supervisors are requested to offer these options to their employees on the basis of mutual trust (i.e. a doctor’s certificate is generally not necessary).
If no alternative measures (e.g. working from home) are possible, a doctor’s note would need to be provided in due course.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy always presents a special situation. If you are unsure whether particular protective measures need to be taken due to the current coronavirus situation to protect employees who are pregnant, you can contact the Occupational Medicine team within the Safety, Security and Environment Office.

Information for Teaching Staff
UZH operating on skeleton staff
As of 17 March 2020, the University of Zurich is operating on skeleton staff. Before, the Executive Board of the University has already decided to switch all courses to a distance-learning format from Monday, 16 March 2020 onwards until further notice.

Measures to Keep Courses Running
The special situation caused by the spread of the coronavirus means special measures are required to keep courses running. The Executive Board of the University therefore requests that you take measures to enable students who are staying at home to continue to follow their courses. It should also be made possible for students to complete assessments for the courses they have taken this Spring Semester without them having to be physically present.

The following possibilities are available:

1. Upload teaching materials to suitable sharing platforms
Provide students with online access to teaching materials (for example slides, lecture notes and texts) that serve as a substitute for classroom teaching for an indefinite period of time. In addition, supplement the teaching materials with homework assignments. Use sharing platforms on which it is possible to restrict access. We recommend the university’s OLAT platform. This can be used for all kinds of events. You can find out how to set up OLAT courses on the OLAT Website:
Online Learning and Training (OLAT)
For technical support with OLAT courses contact support@olat.uzh.ch

2. Record lectures in suitably equipped lecture halls (podcasts)
UZH has over 45 lecture halls that are equipped for recording podcasts. Video and audio are recorded together with your presentation. Ideally, you would include the podcast in an OLAT course and make it available there for students.
You can find a list of the relevant lecture halls, instructions for how to use the equipment and contacts for technical support on the Information Technology website  List of the relevant lecture halls (in German)
Please note that from Tuesday, 24 March, recordings will only be possible at Irchel Campus and in the Main Building on the City Campus.

A guide to recording events can be found on the following website:
Event recording in lecture halls (in German)

You can get technical support for recording by calling 044 6342451 or e-mailing avs-support@id.uzh.ch.

3. Record presentations with a soundtrack from your desk
If you are not able or not permitted to be present at UZH in person, or you do not have any teaching materials suitable for upload, a simple option is to record your PowerPoint presentation with a soundtrack. As well as the actual presentation, for optimum quality you need an external microphone (headset or headphones with microphone). The files can be exported as MPEG4 or MP4 video (medium quality 1280x720 is generally sufficient) and ideally are integrated into an OLAT course.

A guide to recording presentations and uploading them to SWITCHcast or SWITCHtube can be found on the following Information Technology website:
Recording at home (in German)

You can find instructions for recording in PowerPoint on the Microsoft Office Website:
Microsoft Office: Record a slide show

4. Publication of self-produced videos
Videos you have produced yourself can be uploaded to SWITCHcast or SWITCHtube and from there published in various ways (via OLAT, a protected website or by sending a link). Information on choosing which platform and how to get access rights can be found on the following website:
Distribution platforms SWITCHcast and SWITCHtube (in German)

5. Adapt student assessments
If your course includes assessment tasks that have to be done in the classroom, please adapt them so that students working at home are also able to complete and be assessed for the tasks (e.g. written contributions as a substitute for verbal contributions). Degree program coordinators should support module coordinators and teaching staff in this regard. OLAT courses offer a wide variety of possibilities. You can obtain information and support from OLAT support and from the eLearning coordinators of your faculty. Information on technical support for events is available on the following website:
Information Technology: Event support (in German)

6. Microsoft Office 365/Teams
The Executive Board of the University has also decided to make Microsoft Office 365/Teams available for all teaching staff. This software enables courses to be run online. You can find detailed instructions on the following website:
Office 365 / Teams: Installation, Instructions and Support (in German)


Information for Researchers
Status: 20 March 2020, 5:00 p.m.
Only Exceptional Research On-Site
The University of Zurich began operating on a skeleton staff starting on 17 March 2020. As a result, only people who are overseeing crucial research systems and experiments may stay in the university’s buildings. During the skeleton operations phase, UZH employees may only work on ecxeptional research projects requiring on-site presence and on-site resources.

1. Research operations shut down with few exceptions
UZH is completely shutting down all research operations requiring on-site presence and on-site resources with only a few exceptions that require prior authorization.

2. Approval for exceptional projects
Formal approval is required for a research project to qualify as exceptional. This approval will be issued to projects meeting specific criteria. The responsible decision-making body is under the leadership of the Vice President Research.
Criteria and procedure for approval

3. Permission for entering workplaces
UZH staff may only enter their workplaces with written non-transferable permission from the Executive Board. Anyone who is part of an exceptional research project will receive the authorization needed to enter UZH buildings.

4. Access to libraries
Libraries will not be accessible, with the exception of select members of the library staff. Researchers should use the electronic collections. Physical documents can be sent to you free of charge if you place an online order.
Information of the UZH libraries

5. Resources from support organizations
Research projects that have officially received exceptional status must check with the organizations that they rely on (support organizations such as LASC, technology platforms or other services) in order to ensure that these organizations can still continue to provide the necessary resources and services during the coronavirus pandemic (e.g. they could have insufficient supplies or a lack of materials). This is the responsibility of the research project leader.

6. Invalidation of approval
If an exceptional research project must be halted due to the inability of a support organization to continue providing the necessary resources and services, the exceptional status of the project becomes invalid, and employees who are involved lose their right to enter UZH premises.

7. Projects outside of UZH premises
Exceptional research projects that are conducted in Switzerland outside of UZH premises (e.g. field research and critical long-term measurements) are also subject to authorization and can be applied for in the same way.

8. Research on Corona
Exceptional research projects that contribute to our understanding of the coronavirus will be approved and given the highest priority.

9. Conducting research remotely
All research that can be conducted remotely will continue as usual.

10. Research in the university hospitals
Due to the special situation, the deans of the Vetsuisse Faculty and the Faculty of Medicine will decide, in consultation with the hospitals, what constitutes minimal research operations in the university hospitals. This is to avoid conflicts between research activities and operations for the welfare of humans and animals. Dual institutes shall follow the guidelines of the leading faculty.

Exceptional Research Projects
Criteria for Exceptional Research Projects
There are three main groups of criteria that qualify a research project as exceptional important and therefore permit its continuation:

The research project makes an significant contribution to combatting the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (see clarification below).
The interruption to a long-term series of tests would entail unacceptable losses (see clarification below)..
The research involves collecting long-term measurements or the upkeep of a series of long-term measurements outside of the University, insofar as researchers still have the necessary access.
Significant contribution to combatting the pandemic
The following criteria will be used to evaluate whether a research project makes an important contribution to overcoming the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic:

Limiting the spread of the coronavirus
Combatting the health consequences of infection
Protection against coronavirus infection
Measures for containing the spread of the coronavirus
Prevention of irreversible damage brought on by the pandemic
Tracing the origins, spread and future development of the virus
Developing preventive measures as well as new measures for the future
Interruption would entail unacceptable losses
For approval for the continuation of long-term experiments, in particular animal experiments, the various consequences of continuing and discontinuing the studies will be weighed up to evaluate cases of hardship. Depending on the circumstances, a panel of experts may be consulted for evaluation. Important criteria are:

Ensuring that samples can be prepared and stored at the defined measurement intervals
Animal welfare
The time period required to obtain all planned samples is at least three times shorter than the time required to restart and perform the test series again.
The timespan between starting a new series of tests and being able to collect measurements
Important note
In case you foresee that the analysis of already existing samples or their preparation for long-term storage can not be delayed but can not be completed before March 25th, contact immediately Thomas Trüb, responsible for triage of application, either by phone or email.

Procedure for Authorization
Applications for Exceptional Research Project must be submitted by email in the format provided (form (DOCX, 52 KB)) to the triage team in the Office of the Vice President for Research (exceptional@research.uzh.ch). The triage team is headed by Thomas Trüb, Head Strategic Research Platforms (thomas.trueb@uzh.ch; +41 44 635 41 31).

Applications absolutely must include:

Description of and justification for the research project
Time required to achieve the objectives
Required staff resources from own team (names, time required)
Necessary third-party resources and dependencies (e.g. LASC, technology platforms)
Approval from department/institute head
Applications will then be evaluated by a small committee. Each review will involve the participation of the Department of Research Development, two deans or vice deans and the aforementioned triage team.

The triage team is responsible for communicating the decision. No appeals can be made.

Supporting Your Return to Switzerland
At UZH we have a duty of care to our employees and must also protect our students. In light of the current situation, we therefore recommend that all UZH members who are currently abroad return to Switzerland, in order to avoid the risk either of becoming ill or of later no longer having the option to return home.

UZH members who are currently abroad should note the following points:

The Federal Council has called upon Swiss citizens to return to Switzerland as quickly as possible and to register on the Travel Admin App of the FDFA.
UZH encourages its members who are currently abroad to respond to this call. This advice is on the proviso that a return journey is possible and does not pose a greater risk than staying put.
There are some reasons that would justify staying abroad, for example if the situation where you are is less serious than in Switzerland, the local health system is reliable and you feel comfortable with staying there. 
UZH can provide assistance for UZH members for questions regarding stays abroad and return travel. Please contact iro@int.uzh.ch.
If you find yourself in a difficult situation abroad in a country outside of the Schengen Area and require professional support (e.g. medical questions and emergencies, security emergencies and travel problems), the Travel Assistance Provider International SOS is available. You can request details of how to access the SOS app from info@su.uzh.ch.
For UZH staff only:
Please contact iro@int.uzh.ch plus your supervisor or line manager by 31 March to confirm that you have received this message and taken note of its contents. Please also let them know how you intend to proceed. 
Exceptional authorization for research trips or to stay abroad for research activities will be issued under the same procedure that is now in place for the authorization of exceptional research projects. You can find all necessary information regarding such exceptions on the following website: Criteria for Exceptional Research Projects
UZH reserves the right, depending on the circumstances of individual cases and on how the situation develops, to order UZH employees who are abroad on professional assignments to return to Switzerland.
